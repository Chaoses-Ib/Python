# Hatch
[Show HN: Hatch 1.0.0 -- Modern, extensible Python project management | Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31190027)

> From what I understand, Hatch fixes a core failure of Poetry & PDM: if you have a tool that is not a library (say Black), it should not be able to collide with another tool you are using (say TensorFlow). For a while, black and TensorFlow could not be installed in the same environment due to bad upper caps (In Python, never upper cap without proof it fails or will fail, seeÂ <https://iscinumpy.dev/post/bound-version-constraints/>) - and that's fine, TensorFlow and Black don't use each other. But Poetry/PDM will fail (and this is why Poetry's solve times can be insane). Hypermodern-python still tries to jam everything into a massive Poetry dev environment, which can create multi-hour solves if you add things like TensorFlow.

> Today we've been "fixing" this by using nox or tox, and avoiding adding everything into a big "dev" environment. But the draw of Poetry/PDM was supposed to be "A single tool". Very excited to see where this goes! I've already enjoyed hatchling, which can be used on it's own with other systems. :) (Except Poetry, which doesn't play well with standards or anyone else).
